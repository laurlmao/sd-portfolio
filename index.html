                        <p>this project was just a basic webpage we made when learning about inputs and outputs. the player would type in a number in the top and bottom row as well as the color and the computer would print out boxes with the number of rows and columns and the same color that the user picked.</p>

                        <p>this project was a basic webpage with three inputs- a color picker, and two inputs that determined the number of rows and columns of coloured squares (colour chosen by the colour picker) should have.</p>

                        <p>for this project, Linden and I paired up with the intentions of recreating the popular and discontinued mobile game "Flappy Bird". To do so, we enlisted the help of chatgpt, however we tweaked the code ourselves and had to change around a lot in order to ensure we understood what we were doing and why.</p>
